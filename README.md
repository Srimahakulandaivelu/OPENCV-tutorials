**INTRODUCTION**
Introduction to OpenCV and computer vision

Installing OpenCV and Caer

**SECTION #1 ‚Äì BASICS**
This section covers the fundamental operations and manipulations of images and videos using OpenCV.

_Reading Images & Video_: Learn how to load and display images and video streams.

_Resizing and Rescaling Frames_: Techniques for adjusting the dimensions of images and video frames.

_Drawing Shapes & Putting Text_: How to draw basic geometric shapes and add text overlays on images.

_5 Essential Functions in OpenCV_: Explore crucial functions for common image processing tasks.

_Image Transformations_: Understanding translation, rotation, and other geometric transformations.

_Contour Detection_: Identifying and drawing contours (outlines) of objects in an image.

**SECTION #2 ‚Äì ADVANCED**
Dive deeper into image processing with topics like color manipulation, filtering, and more complex image analysis.

_Color Spaces_: Explore different color representations (e.g., RGB, HSV, Lab) and their applications.

_Color Channels_: Working with individual color channels of an image.

_Blurring_: Applying various blurring techniques (e.g., Gaussian, Median, Bilateral) for noise reduction and smoothing.

_Bitwise Operations_: Performing bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations on images.

_Masking_: Applying masks to images to isolate specific regions of interest.

_Histogram Computation_: Understanding and computing image histograms for intensity distribution analysis.

_Thresholding / Binarizing Images_: Converting grayscale images to binary images based on a threshold.

_Edge Detection_: Detecting edges in images using algorithms like Canny.

**SECTION #3 ‚Äì FACES**
This section focuses on practical applications of computer vision related to facial analysis.

_Face Detection with Haar Cascades_: Implementing real-time face detection using pre-trained Haar cascades.

_Face Recognition with OpenCV's Built-in Recognizer_: Exploring techniques for identifying individuals from images.

**SECTION #4 ‚Äì CAPSTONE**
**Deep Computer Vision ‚Äì The Simpsons**: A capstone project applying computer vision techniques, potentially involving more advanced concepts like deep learning for object recognition (e.g., identifying Simpsons characters).
