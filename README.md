üìö **OpenCV Tutorial**

Welcome to the OpenCV Tutorial repository! This repository contains Python code examples and explanations for various computer vision concepts using the OpenCV library. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, this tutorial aims to provide a clear and concise learning path.

üåü **About This Repository**

This repository is structured to follow a progressive learning curve, starting from the basics of image and video manipulation to more advanced topics like contour detection, color spaces, and even face recognition. Each section builds upon previous concepts, providing a solid foundation in computer vision.

üöÄ **Getting Started**

To run the code examples in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed along with the opencv-python and caer libraries.

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.x

üìñ**Course Contents**


**INTRODUCTION:**

Introduction to OpenCV and computer vision.
Installing OpenCV and Caer.

**Section #1 - Basics**

This section covers the fundamental operations and manipulations of images and videos using OpenCV.

_Reading Images & Video_: Learn how to load and display images and video streams.
_Resizing and Rescaling Frames_: Techniques for adjusting the dimensions of images and video frames.
_Drawing Shapes & Putting Text_: How to draw basic geometric shapes and add text overlays on images.
_5 Essential Functions in OpenCV_: Explore crucial functions for common image processing tasks.
_Image Transformations_: Understanding translation, rotation, and other geometric transformations.
_Contour Detection_: Identifying and drawing contours (outlines) of objects in an image.

**Section #2 - Advanced**

Dive deeper into image processing with topics like color manipulation, filtering, and more complex image analysis.

_Color Spaces_: Explore different color representations (e.g., RGB, HSV, Lab) and their applications.
_Color Channels_: Working with individual color channels of an image.
_Blurring_: Applying various blurring techniques (e.g., Gaussian, Median, Bilateral) for noise reduction and smoothing.
_BITWISE operations_: Performing bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations on images.
_Masking_: Applying masks to images to isolate specific regions of interest.
_Histogram Computation_: Understanding and computing image histograms for intensity distribution analysis.
_Thresholding/Binarizing Images_: Converting grayscale images to binary images based on a threshold.
_Edge Detection_: Detecting edges in images using algorithms like Canny.

**Section #3 - Faces**

This section focuses on practical applications of computer vision related to facial analysis.

_Face Detection with Haar Cascades_: Implementing real-time face detection using pre-trained Haar cascades.
_Face Recognition with OpenCV's built-in recognizer_: Exploring techniques for identifying individuals from images.

**Section #4 - Capstone**

_Deep Computer Vision_: The Simpsons: A capstone project applying computer vision techniques, potentially involving more advanced concepts like deep learning for object recognition (e.g., identifying Simpsons characters).
